**quori_ws**

This is an initial attempt to convert the quori_ros running in ROS to ROS2. Currently quori_gazebo, quori_description and quori_controller are the only packages converted to ROS2. The rest of the ROS2 packages are empty. quori_controller does not compile to see the issues view the package README file. 

**Prerequisites**

The package is compatible with Ubuntu 22.04 / ROS Humble.

**Future Work**
There are a number of options in order to get the quori project working in ROS2.

1. Continue to migrate the ROS1 packages to ROS2. https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/The-ROS2-Project/Contributing/Migration-Guide.html
